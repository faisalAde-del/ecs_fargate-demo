**ECS Fargate Demo – Containerized App with Terraform**

This is a simple but complete example of how I’d package and run a web application in AWS ECS Fargate using Docker and Terraform.
For this version, I’ve kept everything cost-safe by running it locally — but the same setup can go live in AWS in minutes.

**What This Project Is About**

I wanted to show the full container workflow from building an image → storing it in ECR → running it in ECS Fargate → scaling with an Application Load Balancer, all automated with Terraform.

This project is a good example of:
	•	Structuring cloud-native infrastructure as code
	•	Keeping deployments repeatable and consistent
	•	Designing for scalability and security from the start

**How It Works**


	1.	The app – just a lightweight HTML page, running in an Nginx container.
	2.	Terraform code – defines:
	•	An ECR repository (for storing the container image)
	•	An ECS Fargate service (serverless container hosting)
	•	An ALB (to spread traffic across tasks)
	•	IAM roles and autoscaling policies
	3.	Local mode – for this demo, I only run the container locally to avoid AWS costs.
	4.	Cloud mode – swap in real AWS credentials, run terraform apply, and it’s production-ready.

Now open http://localhost:8080 in your browser

**Why This Matters for Businesses**

In the real world, this setup lets teams:
	•	Scale apps automatically when traffic increases
	•	Reduce costs by using Fargate’s pay-for-what-you-use model
	•	Secure deployments with fine-grained IAM access
	•	Keep environments consistent from laptop to production

It’s the same approach I’d take for a real client project, just stripped down here so you can see the moving parts clearly.

**Next Steps for This Project**
	•	Add CloudWatch logging
	•	Add HTTPS via AWS ACM certificates
	•	Hook into a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments

**About Me**

 
I’m a Cloud & DevOps Engineer who enjoys taking ideas from “just an idea” to a running, scalable system in AWS. I love working with tools like Terraform, Docker, and ECS to make deployments smooth and predictable. My focus is on building solutions that are secure, cost-efficient, and easy to grow as the business grows.
